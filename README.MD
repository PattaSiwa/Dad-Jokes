Dad Joke Generator

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Axios

This project was created to practice using Axios framework. It consumes data from icanhazdadjokes.com to generate dad jokes on screen when a user click on the button. Axios along with JavaScript request and parse JSON data from the web API to be used in this application. The DOM manipulation is all done with vanilla JavaScript. 

I want to thank Colt Steele for the Axios tutorial video in his Web Development Udemy Course.
